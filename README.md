# esp32ProxyAPSAT
This code makes your esp 32 work as a wifi client as well as an wifi AP. Essentially a proxy, as in the code below, you can modify any content through the esp32 from what the user is browsing.  In the above code I have replaced https with WHAT-IS-THIS, any text can be replaced like this. This code can also be used to use the ESP32 as a wifi range extender
